* [nameof](https://github.com/Neargye/nameof) - Used to obtain the simple name of a variable, type, member, function, macros and etc.

* [defer](https://github.com/Neargye/scope_guard) - A "DEFER" statement invokes a function whose execution is deferred to the moment the surrounding function returns, either because the surrounding function executed a return statement, reached the end of its function body, or because the exception was thrown.

* [unused](include/unused.hpp) - Macros with varying number of arguments to avoid "unused variable" warnings.
